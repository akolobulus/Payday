PAYDAY Pitch Deck (Updated Draft)

1. Problem: The "Broke Days" Crisis in Nigeria

Millions of Nigerian undergraduates & fresh graduates face “broke days” when basic needs (transport, food, rent) can’t be met.

70% of Nigerian students rely on irregular financial support.

Challenges:

1. Scarcity of Short-Term Gigs – Few legitimate opportunities for flexible, quick work.


2. Delayed Payments – Even when gigs exist, payments can take weeks.


3. Lack of Trust – Youths fear scams or unreliable posters.


Impact: Academic distraction, mental stress, stunted productivity, and reduced participation in the economy.

2. Solution: Payday – Instant Relief, Local Opportunity

Payday is a secure, mobile-first platform that connects Nigerian youths with verified, same-day paying gigs.

Vision: Turn youth skills into instant income, eliminate “broke days,” and fuel a trusted youth-driven gig economy.

Scope: Nationwide access – Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan, Jos, Port Harcourt, and more.
